KAYA IDENTITY(PROJECT)

Assignment Instructions

    1) Choose a country from the top 20 CO₂ emitting countries in the world – exclude India and the USA.
    2) Extract the following data from the EIA website:
          Primary energy supply by fuels/energy source
          CO₂ emissions by energy source
          Total electricity generation
          GDP
          Population
    3) Replication exercise:
          Undertake an analysis similar to that presented in Chapter 7 of the Human Ambitions book for your chosen country.
          Undertake an analysis similar to that presented in the Drivers of Accelerating CO₂ Emissions paper for your chosen country.
    4) Compare with SDR data - look at the Codebook sheet of the SDR data to see indicator definitions.
          Calculate the ratio of Total CO₂ emissions and Total electricity generated and compare with the SDR data for indicator sdg7_co2twh (7.2).
          Calculate the share of renewable energy in the primary energy supply and compare with SDR data for indicator sdg7_renewcon (7.2.1).
    5) Using this analysis, identify possible research questions.
    6) Present your findings in a report with appropriate sections and in academic language. Keep the codes/Excel files in an organized manner and presentable format. I may request them if required.


I have downloaded data from 'https://www.eia.gov/'. The particular link where the datasets were present goes by- 'https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/other-statistics/emissions-by-fuel?pd=40&p=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b0001&u=0&f=A&v=mapbubble&a=-&i=none&vo=value&t=C&g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&s=-662688000000&e=1640995200000'

I have downloded data for Country Germany and the World Total data. The data variables were- CO2 emissions, Gross Domestic Product, Population, Primary Energy Consumption (The data of Primary energy consumption at EIA is analogous to primary energy supplt at IEA), and Energy Generation. 
I will arrange the codes, files and the graphs in two ways. First way- Divide directories in terms of replication exercises and store the assosciated codes, files and graphs. Second way- Make three seperate directories for \Data, \Graphs, \Codes.

The analysis of the project will be saved in Report.pdf in teh current directory.

Some files may have the same name, like Kaya.csv and Kaya_new.csv. Consider the file conataining 'new' in the file name. They are the correct ones.

Thanks
